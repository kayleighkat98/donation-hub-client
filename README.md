In most scenarios, people are willing to donate. However, it is not always clear what organizations
really need or how much of what they are seeking is needed. In order to help strengthen the donation 
process, we decided to create Donation Hub. DonationHub exists as a way to centralize the efforts community
champions (donators) need in order to best serve their communities. By using the DonationHub website, users 
are able to locate organization near them, browse items that location needs, and give as they please accordingly. 
Users are also able to go in and add donation sites for organizations that may not be as internet accesible. 

In order to ensure the app works to its fullest potential, the following technology was used in its creation:

Frontend: 
    ReactJS
    CSS
    Jest
    JWT   

Backend:
    ExpressJS
    Bcryptjs
    Mocha/Chai
    Postgres
        GIST Index for performant box intersection query

Third Party APIs:
    Google Maps
    Google Places

Deployment:
    Vercel 
    Heroku
